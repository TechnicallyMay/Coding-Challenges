## Seven figure display
Input.txt will accept input in the form of 's n' where 's' is the size and
'n' is a number. The program will write those digits out in the format of a 7
figure display using '-' and '|' symbols. If the input is '0 0' the program
will stop reading the input.

# Usage

Enter input into input.txt
cd to folder
